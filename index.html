        Let's see how this drama goes. I am originally from Peru, been here in the states since 2014. This is a
        beautiful country full of life-changing opportunities; now you know why so many people are trying to jump the
        wall! ok, that was a bad joke lets switch topics.<br>
        </br>
        I am 23 years old and I currently work as an Underwriter Assistant, we do this fun activity that consists of
        sitting down all day long in front of a computer checking and verifying policies and prices, ain't that fun? I
        have been in the insurance industry for the last 4 years, started as an Auto Insurance Sales Agent (nice title
        but not my thing); 3 years after realized that I was ,as many others, an unhappy employee and that was holding
        onto a place/position (good pay) that made me miserable. Did you spot the problem? it took me 3 YEARS to realize
        it and face it; with that in mind, just imagine how my love life went. <br>
        </br>
        I left that job last year and I have never felt so relieved. Had a long month of wonderful vacation and
        interviews, of course, until I came across a great company, SIU. They are truly awesome, I love this family
        oriented culture all around the company, well it's also a family owned business I guess it makes sense right? I
        have one of the sweetest managers I have ever had in my life and the most important detail, they offer several
        food events for the employees all year around and that right there is pure love, at least for me. At this point
        you may be questioning, why are you reading this?...(I am asking that too) Well I had to write a little
        something about me for this page and this is all I am coming up with. Let me also tell you that I have always
        been very curious about computers and did very well in my computer science class(do not ask me about the rest),
        also took some extracurricular classes after hig like Microsoft, Corel Draw, C++, Web development(beginners,
        nothing like this boot camp) but little did I know that coding was going to be my next big step in life. To be
        fully honest with everyone reading this, prior landing to Georgia, I had done some research about universities
        and colleges in the Atlanta area and had found not only good but amazing information and reviews about Georgia
        Tech, so I had this naive idea that I was going to walk to GT and enroll and we were all going to be happy (yes
        I laugh at it, now); little Claudia had forgotten about a substantial detail "THE MONEY", who on earth was going
        to pay the small fee of 40,000 a year? It was disappointing but also challenging and I love challenges so yes,
        one thing leads to another and I am finally about to achieve one of the very first goals I had when I got to
        America.<br>
        </br>
        Programming obviously was not my first choice. I changed majors so many times, when I was enrolled in GTC, to
        the point that I was embarrassed to go to the Student Advisor with a new made-up excuse of why this was my third
        consecutive change of majors in one academic year (yes, that many). Currently all the ups and downs pretty much
        worked out, because I feel back in place and moreover pretty confident about my future success in this class. I
        am thankful to be part of this group and I know wonderful things will come out of this experience.
